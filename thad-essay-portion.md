This project focused more on strategically re-inventing the wheel in the name of developing a deeper understanding of the material than developing new knowledge. Our results demonstrate the computational and algorithmic difficulties encountered in k-mer optimization problems. In particular, we encountered characteristic challenges in terms of k-mer size. These challenges manifested in extended run times even with short k-mers and low accuracy. Despite this, we present a working re-implementation of a  solution to a fundamental and challenging problem relevant to the course material. If we were to revisit this problem again we would structure our approach around high-performance computing from the start. We would also consider using more contemporary tools such as STREAM (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/18/2834/6184861).
