Initially, my role in the project was suggesting topics were we could try to (re)implement something in a way that would be educationally useful. Once we landed on a topic, I took on the role of the behind-the-scenes tech person, setting up a git repo, showing people how to use it, and organizing it in such a way that people who were used to simply using google co-lab wouldn't have to change the workflow. I think got HOMER working on my local machine though the experiment I did with it was dropped for time. After this, I transitioned to a back-end developer role. Group members told me what they wanted to do for a k-mer experiment and I wrote functions and small scripts that they could import into their notebooks to arrange into an experiment easily. I also wrote some basic documentation so people could make sense of the API while I wasn't available. Throughout the project, we all discussed the experiments and presented various troubleshooting strategies. I also wrote ad hoc code for people when small, unexpected things came up in their analysis (fasta parsing, etc). I participated in writing and reviewing the final essay and slides.
